# Mainframe-Sample-CICS-Monitor
Sample Mainframe CICS Monitor

This program was developed a couple of years ago when I was working in the CICS Monitoring Lab. Basically it is the modified version of the CICS CEMT transaction. I used those programs to test new CICS features and to create new dashboards before going to the oficial product.

This source code was compiled last time with the CICS/ESA version 4.x. As it is full command level, I think should work in the recent versions of CICS.

As many friends asked for this source code to learn Assembler/370, I decided to share all source code thus available to other Mainframe colleagues.
